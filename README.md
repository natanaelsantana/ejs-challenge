# **ejs-challenge**

This is part of The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu,
And she gave the skeleton project, just some empty ejs, css and html files.
Now it has a database thats store every post the user makes.

She did that because the main goal of the project is to improve the logic and focus in the language.
Of course, i had to write most part of the project.

I hope you enjoy! I leave to you some prints in the final of the instructions.
note: Now, if you want to store the posts, you need to set up mongoDB
